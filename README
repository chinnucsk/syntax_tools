Syntax Tools is a library for handling abstract Erlang syntax trees, in a
way that is compatible with the "parse trees" of the standard library
module `erl_parse', together with utilities for reading source files in
unusual ways and pretty-printing syntax trees. Also included is a module
merger and renamer called Igor, as well as an automatic code-cleaner.
